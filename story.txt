Interactive Rebase/Merge Story
==============================

A lot of your team members are quite lazy and avoid moving their hands too much
at work. Your boss don't like that, because he get's a lot of text hard to read
since merly anybody wants to use the shift key and just type all lowercase.

You -- you don't how that could happen -- are now in charge to make the world a
better place and write a small script to fix capitals.


Take the driver seat
--------------------

You have just written a very simple script. It works. And you have pushed it on
master. Everything is great -- job is done. You even implemented a test case.
Your boss is already out of office, and you will be in vacaction the next two
weeks.
No time for documentation. But anyway, you know your code, don't you?
